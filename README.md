**What is EPSS?**
Epss is the exploit Prediction Scoring system. This score includes using CVSS information and other machine learning based on a CVE's attributes such as vendor and type of exploit. To read the full white paper on the scoring system you can access it here https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04856 


# EPSS-vuln-retreiver-
A basic python script for making the API call to First.org to retrieve information on EPSS scores for vulnerabilities. 
All you need to do is change out the vulnerabilities in the script around line 28. modify these with the CVE's you want the EPSS score for.
