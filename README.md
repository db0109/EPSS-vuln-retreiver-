**What is EPSS?**
Epss is the exploit Prediction Scoring system. This score includes using CVSS information and other machine learning based on a CVE's attributes such as vendor and other information. this then gives an estimate on how likely a vulnerbility is to be exploited. This number can and will change over time. 


# EPSS-vuln-retreiver-
A basic python script for making the API call to First.org to retrieve information on EPSS scores for vulnerabilities. 
All you need to do is change out the vulnerabilities in the script around line 28. modify these with the CVE's you want the EPSS score for.
